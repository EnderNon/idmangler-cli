# Name
This data block encodes for the name of an item.
- Field name: `name`
- Field type: `String`
- Example: `"name":"Singularity"`
- **NOTES FOR GEAR TYPE ITEMS**: 
  - It must be a valid Wynncraft item name for it to display as intended.
  - in game, the name has a limit of 48 characters. That means that the final tier Legendary Island item, "Outlandish Replica Face Mask of Legendary Victory", only encodes up to "Victor". Thus, it does not work in game. ![frfr.png](../images/outlandish_mask.png)
